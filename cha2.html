        2. 	What are its welfare needs (nutrition, health, environment, behaviour, mental state)?
    </h3>
    <ul>
        The giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo which consists of 12 genera and over 60 species. In addition, giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat animal carcasses or other plants.
Captive giant pandas mainly feed on one or several kinds of bamboo that grow near mountain bases and flatlands, supplemented with concentrated feed made from grains. Bamboo is the key to their growth, physical health, and normal breeding. In recent years, with the advancement of giant panda breeding technology, the importance of providing high-quality alpine or subalpine bamboos to guarantee the health and breeding of giant pandas has gradually been recognized. The improvement of traffic conditions also facilitates the supply of a large number of alpine or sub-alpine bamboos for the giant pandas in captivity.

        Health
        <ul>
            Under natural conditions, diseases may be the biggest threat to the survival of giant pandas. Diseases appearing in the digestive, respiratory, nervous, and hematopoietic systems usually cause death and various tumors, parasitic diseases, skin diseases, injuries, and more to harm the health and longevity of giant pandas. There are digestive system disease, respiratory disease, nervous system disease, hematopoietic system diseases, and parasites and so on.

        Environment
        <ul>
            Giant pandas live in the dense and cloudy forests at an altitude of 2,600 to 3,500m, where the air is thin and the temperature is below 20℃ all year round. Some other factors include the distribution of bamboo, topography and water resources, hiding places, caves for feeding cubs, and mountain gradients, which will also affect the distribution and density of the wild giant panda population. At present, human interference is the main factor affecting their distribution.
     
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Giant pandas have high cold and moisture tolerances and never hibernate. At -4-14℃, they still walk in the bamboo bushes covered in thick snow. Generally, they live in shady and damp places where the humidity is over 80%.

        Behaviour
        <ul>
            Giant pandas spend half the day eating, and most of the rest of their time sleeping. The most adorable feature about giant pandas is their chubby body and slow walking style. You might think that their slow movement merely comes as a result that they live in an environment with plenty of food and no predators. However, it is more about conserving energy and adapting to their low-energy diet. They sometimes also climb trees to scout, escape intruders, or just doze. They are adept tree climbers and love to play.

    </ol>
    <ol>
        Mental State
        <ul>
            Giant pandas usually are very meek. When they first meet people, they would often use their fore foot to cover their faces, or lower their heads to conceal their face. They seldom take the initiative to attack other animals or people and always resort to avoidance when encountering another creature in the wild. But once they enter motherhood, they can become aggressive when protecting their little and inviolable cub. Even if you visit them and demonstrate your non-aggression, the mother will still use her teeth and claws to scare you away.
