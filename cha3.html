        3. 	How this animal would experience what it experiences in a zoo, (such as solitary or herd preferences)
    </h3>
    <ol>
        Pandas are solitary animals but will vocalize during social interactions. They sometimes chirp, honk, bleat, chomp, and bark. They have a highly developed sense of smell that males use to avoid each other and to find females for mating in the spring. After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth to a cub or two, though they cannot care for both twins. The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces at birth and cannot crawl until they reach three months of age. They are born white and develop their much-loved coloring later.
