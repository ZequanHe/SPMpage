        4. 	What conditions are needed for successful captive breeding?
    </h3>
    <ul>
        Suitable living environment

        <ol>
            The most suitable living environment for giant pandas is their native environment. “Captive breeding” changes the living habits and living rules of the animals themselves. To successfully breed in captivity, suitable temperature, humidity, and food are very important factors.

        </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Exercise
        <ol>
            The appropriate amount of exercise is also important. The amount of exercise of wild giant pandas is very large every day. In order to find food, they may walk tens of kilometers of steep mountain roads. However, the activity area of​​captive pandas is very small, and most of them are flat ground. The lack of exercise makes the physical quality of captive giant pandas relatively poor, which will make it difficult for giant pandas to complete natural mating during the mating season.

        </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Timing
        <ol>
            Pandas only have a 36-hour reproductive window every year, and if they miss this time, they have to wait a year. So if you want successful captive breeding, you need to seize the right time.
        </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Guidance and demonstration
        <ol>
            Many giant pandas are bred in captivity or captured in the wild. Without a chance to see how the older pandas mate, the researchers think they may not know how to reproduce at all.
