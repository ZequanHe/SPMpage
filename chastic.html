      1. 	Why giant panda lacks biosecurity and is at risk of extinction?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      Habitat Loss
      <ol>
        Infrastructure development (such as dams, roads, and railways) is increasingly fragmenting and isolating panda populations, preventing pandas from finding new bamboo forests and potential mates. Forest loss also reduces pandas' access to the bamboo they need to survive.
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Harvesting
      <ol>
        The panda's mountainous forests continue to be degraded by people harvesting bamboo, gathering firewood and collecting medicinal herbs.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        The Minshan Mountains alone contain over 5,000 plant species: 75% of which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Harvesting these medicinal plants provides many families with an important source of income. But it also places additional pressure on the fragile forests.
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      hunting
      <ol>
        Some poaching of pandas still occurs. Hunting the animals for their fur has declined due to strict laws and greater public awareness of the pandaâ€™s protected status. While it is rare for poachers to intentionally kill a panda, some are accidentally injured or killed by traps and snares set for other animals, such as musk deer and black bears.
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      tourism
      <ol>
        As does mass tourism. The construction of tourist facilities and the rapidly increasing number of tourists in the forests is causing significant disturbance to pandas and their habitats.
      </ol>
    </ul>
