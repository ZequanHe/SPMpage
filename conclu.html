        1.animal’s welfare response to captivity
    </h3>
    <ol>
        There is wide variation in how animals respond to captivity, and in some cases chronic stress seems to be an influence[1]. Captive wild animals generally receive ample food and water, veterinary care, and protection from predation and conflict. Consequently, they are often healthier, live
longer and breed more successfully than conspecifics living free in their natural environments. However, not all captive wild animals flourish in this way, with some surviving and breeding far less well than might be expected. Furthermore, the evidence of compromised welfare often suggests that physiological or psychological needs are not being met.

        2.community engagement with animals in a zoo
    </h3>
    <ol>
        Community participation is an effective tool for biodiversity conservation and socio-economic development[2]. Take the giant panda as an example. Eco-tourism in some panda reserves in China can not only better protect the giant panda, but also promote local economic development. In other panda reserves that have not been developed for eco-tourism, there are economic losses due to the destruction of crops by wild animals. Therefore, the local government should make proper decisions to consider both animal protection and local social development.

        3.conservation trends and decisions
    </h3>
    <ol>
        The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reduced the threat status of the giant panda from “endangered” to “vulnerable” in September 2016. By the end of 2013, the number of wild pandas reached 1864, representing an increase of 16.8% from the end of 2001. There are many reasons for this increase in giant panda numbers and area of giant panda habitat. The Chinese government has placed great effort on the protection of giant pandas and their habitat. However, panda conservation is still under pressure, particularly due to habitat loss and fragmentation, which greatly increases the risk of small and isolated panda populations becoming extinct. Consequently, the IUCN assessment leading to the classification of giant panda as “vulnerable” instead of “endangered”, should not affect its conservation intensity and effort, as such actions could negatively impact population recovery efforts, leading to the extinction of this charismatic species.

        4.Evaluated the Sixth Mass Extinction body of knowledge
    </h3>
    <ol>
        The loss of biodiversity is one of the most serious global environmental problems caused by humans. Geologically speaking, the most abundant biota on earth has entered its sixth mass extinction[4]. At least 200 vertebrate species have become extinct in the last 100 years, and the disappearance of the last 200 May have taken 10,000 years. In addition, 42 percent of 3,623 land invertebrate species are listed as threatened with extinction. In the long term, the loss of species is irreversible and could have profound effects.
